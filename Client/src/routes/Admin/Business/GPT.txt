Create a Svelte form for adding and deleting businesses using SvelteKit. 
The form should have a hidden field for the BusinessId, which is obtained 
from the URL query parameter 'businessId'. The form should also have a 
text input field for the business name, and two buttons for saving and 
deleting a business. The JavaScript for handling the save and delete 
actions should be in separate files named 'handleSave.js' and 
'handleDelete.js', respectively. The form should be inside a Svelte 
component named '+page.svelte' in the 'src/routes/Businesses' folder.
